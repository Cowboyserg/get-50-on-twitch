This program help you to automatically get `Channel Points` on https://www.twitch.tv/ as soon as icon with points will appears or delayed up to 6 seconds.

Also this program will work with every possible display resolution. 

You should run `my_main.py`.

The difference between `my_main.py` and `main.py` is that function to find icon with points was taken from another project, so it works not fast enough.
